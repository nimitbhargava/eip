Why cnn?
convert data into image (matrix)
channels
the bored cat experiment

radioactive glucose

edges and gradient -> texture -> patterns -> parts of object -> objects -> scene

listening to convolution as features extractor

channel
kernal - feature extractor - 3x3 matrix - are same

kernal is what makes the channel

as long as dataset is same, kernal will be same

(trasnfer learning)

training network on images set or coco

what is convolution - purple thing is the image
each block is a pixel
4x4 pixel - 0,255
grey is kernal
each point on the green image 
scream loud to find that line

every pixel on green is called 

input channel - 4x4
output channel - 2x2
kernal size - 3x3 (always *) - and we use 1x1


our kernal does not fo our od the image


n-2

receptive field

global receptive field
---
how many layers would we need to move from 400x400 image to 100 numbers - 200



back propogation - maxpooling

alex net

add convolution layer
add maxpooling much later

improve more than 0.98%
